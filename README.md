# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard – Microsoft Excel Project

## 📄 Project Overview  
This project features an **interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Excel** to visualize accident data and identify trends in **fatal, serious, and slight severity levels**.  
The goal is to understand accident patterns, analyze **casualties by road type and time period**, and support **data-driven road safety initiatives**.  

The dashboard leverages **Power Query**, **Pivot Tables**, and **dynamic Excel charts** to clean, model, and visualize real-world accident data efficiently.

## 🧩 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Source  
- Dataset: *Road Accident Dataset* (from Kaggle / Open Government Data portal)  
- Fields include:  
  - **Accident Date, Location, Severity (Fatal/Serious/Slight)**  
  - **Road Type, Weather Conditions, Vehicle Type, Casualties**  
  - **Month, Year, and Day of Week**

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Used **Power Query** for preprocessing:
  - Removed duplicates and invalid entries  
  - Standardized severity labels and date formats  
  - Added calculated columns:
    - Month and Year (for time-based insights)  
    - Road Type and Casualty Count (for severity and infrastructure analysis)  

### 3️⃣ Data Analysis & Modeling  
- Built **Pivot Tables** to summarize:
  - Total accidents and casualties by severity  
  - Monthly accident and casualty rates  
  - Road-type-wise breakdown (Highway, Urban Road, Rural Road, etc.)  
- Developed **KPIs**:
  - Total Accidents 🚧  
  - Fatal Accidents 💀  
  - Serious Accidents ⚠️  
  - Slight Accidents 🚗  
  - Total Casualties 🧍‍♂️  
  - Average Monthly Accident Rate 📅

## 📊 Dashboard Design  
The Excel dashboard consists of multiple **interactive visual sections**:

- **Severity Overview:** Fatal, Serious, and Slight accident KPIs  
- **Monthly Accident Rate:** Trend chart showing accidents per month  
- **Casualties by Road Type:** Bar chart comparing casualties across road types  
- **Location Insights:** Map-style visuals to identify high-risk zones  
- **Weather & Vehicle Impact:** Factors contributing to accident severity  
- **Dynamic Filters:** Filter by Year, Region, Road Type, or Severity
